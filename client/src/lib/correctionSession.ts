/**
 * One word, practised as a short lesson.
 *
 * When the app finds a word a learner did not get through, showing the word and
 * "try again" is a marker, not teaching. A teacher does something narrower:
 * points at the place, says it, has the learner say it back, listens to *that*,
 * and only then asks for the whole ayah again. This module holds the state of
 * that little lesson so the screen can render it.
 *
 * **It invents no progress.** Every verdict here comes from a backend result:
 * whether the target word was heard is read from the newest attempt's own
 * corrections list, never from a counter this module keeps. The only local
 * input is `lastAttemptScope` — which of the two record buttons the learner
 * pressed — because the app has to know whether the recording it just sent was
 * one word or a whole ayah in order to read the answer correctly. That is the
 * learner's action, not a judgement about their recitation.
 *
 * **Codex's session wins.** `deriveCorrectionLesson` accepts an optional
 * `session` in the shape the recitation service will supply once the server
 * holds the correction session itself. When it is present, its `stage` and
 * `recognition` are used as given and nothing below is consulted. The
 * derivation exists so this screen works against the contract that ships today,
 * and so swapping in the server's own state is a one-field change.
